## ðŸ“š Projects
### 1. **Mobile Price Classification**
In this project, the task was to build a predictive model that can accurately classify mobile phones into predefined price ranges based on various attributes such as battery power, camera features, memory, connectivity options, and more.

I have built 5 distinct models: *Logistic regression*, *support vector classifier*, *decision tree classifier*, *random forest classifier*, and *gradient boosting classifier*. I did hyperparameter tuning and cross validation with grid search. Then I have deployed the best performing model with Streamlit. The best performing model shows the __98% accuracy__.
